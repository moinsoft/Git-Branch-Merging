    <h1>Git stash</h1>

    <p>git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on. Stashing is handy if you need to quickly switch context and work on something else, but you're mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.</p>

    <h1>Stashing your work</h1>

    <p>The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy</p>
